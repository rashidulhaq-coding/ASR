## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline Details

The CI/CD pipeline is configured using GitHub Actions and automates the following stages:

1. **Linting & Code Formatting**: Ensures code quality and consistency using tools like `flake8` and `black`.
2. **Unit & Integration Testing**: Verifies the correctness of individual components and their interactions with `pytest`.
3. **Build**: Creates Docker images for deployment.
4. **Deployment**: Automatically deploys the application to AWS EC2 instances, updating the ECR repository and managing infrastructure with Terraform.

This automation accelerates the development cycle and minimizes manual errors.
